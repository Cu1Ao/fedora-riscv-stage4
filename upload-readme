This is the current stage4 disk image for the Fedora/RISC-V project:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/RISC-V

Sources for these files can be found in:

To run stage4 (assuming you don't have real hardware) you need
riscv-qemu from
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rjones/riscv/

and then you should be able to run:

  qemu-system-riscv64 \
    -nographic \
    -machine virt \
    -m 2G \
    -kernel bbl \
    -append "console=ttyS0 ro root=/dev/vda init=/init" \
    -device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0 \
    -drive file=stage4-disk.img,format=raw,id=hd0 \
    -device virtio-net-device,netdev=usernet \
    -netdev user,id=usernet

Inside the guest:

(1) Use ‘tdnf’ instead of ‘dnf’ to install packages, eg:

  tdnf install glibc-devel

(2) You may need to edit ‘/etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo’.

(3) You may have to run rpmbuild like this:

  rpmbuild --undefine _annotated_build --define "debug_package %{nil}" ...

(4) You may need to install glibc-devel and other development
packages before building software.

(5) ^C doesn't work, and (for me) DNS doesn't work.  If you know
how to fix these, please let us know!

There is an IRC channel #fedora-riscv on FreeNode for other questions.
