This is the current stage4 disk image for the Fedora/RISC-V project:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/RISC-V

Sources for these files can be found in:

To run stage4 (assuming you don't have real hardware) you need the
latest upstream qemu from git:
https://git.qemu.org/qemu.git/
The FPU is broken in this version of QEMU, you must add this patch:
https://github.com/rwmjones/fedora-riscv-bootstrap/blob/master/stage1-riscv-qemu/force-float-save.patch

Or use the prebuilt qemu packages here:
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rjones/riscv/

and then you should be able to run:

  qemu-system-riscv64 \
    -nographic \
    -machine virt \
    -smp 4 \
    -m 2G \
    -kernel bbl \
    -object rng-random,filename=/dev/urandom,id=rng0 \
    -device virtio-rng-device,rng=rng0 \
    -append "console=ttyS0 ro root=/dev/vda" \
    -device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0 \
    -drive file=stage4-disk.img,format=raw,id=hd0 \
    -device virtio-net-device,netdev=usernet \
    -netdev user,id=usernet,hostfwd=tcp::10000-:22

Note this tries to forward port 10000 on the host to port 22 on the
guest, which should be running the OpenSSH server:

  ssh -p 10000 root@localhost
  root@localhost's password: riscv


Inside the guest:

(1) The root password is: riscv

(2) You may have to run rpmbuild like this:

  rpmbuild --undefine _annotated_build --define "debug_package %{nil}" ...

(3) ‘nano’ and ‘vi’ are available as editors in the base image.
‘emacs-nox’ can be installed using dnf.


There is an IRC channel #fedora-riscv on FreeNode for other questions.
