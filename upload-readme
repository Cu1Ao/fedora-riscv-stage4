The stage4 disk image is built cleanly from RPMs with no broken
dependencies and only three files which are not known to RPM (/init,
/usr/bin/poweroff and /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo, all three will be
replaced when we have systemd and networking).

stage4-disk.img is the usual minimal disk image.

stage4-full-fat-disk.img is the same as stage4-disk.img, plus it
contains all the RPMs available at the time the disk image was built.
This is useful while we don't have networking because it means you can
use 'dnf' to install RPMs on request, but when we have networking
this image will be dropped (because you'll be able to pull the
packages from the repo at https://fedorapeople.org/groups/risc-v/RPMS)

To boot this you will need the qemu-system-riscv from COPR:

# dnf copr enable rjones/riscv
# dnf install riscv-qemu riscv-pk

$ qemu-system-riscv -m 4G -kernel /usr/bin/bbl \
    -append vmlinux \
    -drive file=stage4-disk.img,format=raw -nographic

To install packages inside the VM, use dnf, eg:

# dnf install pcre-devel
