This is the current stage4 disk image for the Fedora/RISC-V project:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/RISC-V

Sources for these files can be found in:

To run stage4 (assuming you don't have real hardware) you need
riscv-qemu from
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rjones/riscv/

and then you should be able to run:

  qemu-system-riscv64 \
    -nographic \
    -machine virt \
    -smp 4 \
    -m 2G \
    -kernel bbl \
    -object rng-random,filename=/dev/urandom,id=rng0 \
    -device virtio-rng-device,rng=rng0 \
    -append "console=ttyS0 ro root=/dev/vda" \
    -device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0 \
    -drive file=stage4-disk.img,format=raw,id=hd0 \
    -device virtio-net-device,netdev=usernet \
    -netdev user,id=usernet,hostfwd=tcp::10000-:22

Note this tries to forward port 10000 on the host to port 22 on the
guest, which should be running the OpenSSH server:

  ssh -p 10000 root@localhost
  root@localhost's password: riscv


Inside the guest:

(1) The root password is: riscv

(2) You may have to run rpmbuild like this:

  rpmbuild --undefine _annotated_build --define "debug_package %{nil}" ...

(3) You may need to install glibc-devel and other development
packages before building software:

  dnf install glibc-devel @buildsys-build

(4) ‘nano’ is available as an editor.

(5) The C++ compiler is broken.  There are two files called
‘c++config.h’, and one of them has an incorrect definition.  COMMENT
OUT the following line.  This will be fixed when we rebuild GCC.

  #define _GLIBCXX_USE_FLOAT128 1


There is an IRC channel #fedora-riscv on FreeNode for other questions.
