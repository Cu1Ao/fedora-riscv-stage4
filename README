This is the Fedora/RISC-V stage4 disk image builder.

If you just want to download the latest stage4 disk image, go to:

  https://fedorapeople.org/groups/risc-v/disk-images/

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The stage4 disk image is a minimal, bootable disk image which runs on
RV64G hardware or the Spike or QEMU emulators.  The image is built
cleanly from RPMs.

Note that it doesn't contain a bootloader or kernel, those are
provided separately.

Every file in the disk image is "known" by RPM, except (currently)
three files:

  /init                        Runs an interactive shell
  /usr/bin/poweroff
  /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo  Points to /var/tmp/RPMS repo (see below).

We have a plan to get rid of these extra files.  The first two will go
once we have built systemd.  The repo file will go once we have
hardware or an emulator that supports networking.

The image is minimal, so it doesn't have things like gcc, rpmbuild,
etc.  However you can install them from RPMs using the 'tdnf' program.
Because there is no networking, you need to download
https://fedorapeople.org/groups/risc-v/RPMS/ (eg. using a recursive
wget) and copy it into the disk image:

  virt-copy-in -a stage4-disk.img /local/copy/of/RPMS /var/tmp

Inside the disk image, install packages by doing:

  tdnf install rpm-build

In the future, tdnf will be replaced by full dnf, and the need to copy
the RPMs directory in will be replaced by network access to the
repository.

To boot the VM, use one of the following commands:

  qemu-system-riscv -m 4G -kernel /usr/bin/bbl \
      -append vmlinux \
      -drive file=stage4-disk.img,format=raw -nographic

  spike +disk=stage4-disk.img /usr/bin/bbl vmlinux

(This assumes privspec 1.7.  Things are going to be a bit different
in privspec 1.9)
