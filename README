This is the Fedora/RISC-V stage4 disk image builder.

If you just want to download the latest stage4 disk image, go to:

The stage4 disk image is a minimal, bootable disk image which runs on
RV64G hardware or the Spike or QEMU emulators.  The image is built
cleanly from RPMs.

Note that it doesn't contain a bootloader or kernel, those are
provided separately.

For instructions on how to use and build disk images, see:
